## Introduction

Mobile devices have become an integral part of our lives, leading to the rapid growth of malware attacks. Users often download applications without considering the permissions granted, making their devices vulnerable to malicious software. This project aims to develop a robust system for efficient malware detection and classification on mobile and IoT devices, using various machine learning models.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a resilient system capable of detecting and classifying malware across a spectrum of devices, including mobile and IoT systems. The machine learning models employed include Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees. The project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Data

The dataset consists of 86 features and 29,333 instances, with each feature representing application permissions. The primary target variable is the classification of data into 'Malware' or 'Benign' categories.

## Models

Three machine learning models are used in this project:

1. **Logistic Regression**: This model provides insights into the probability of data being malware.

2. **K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: KNN is used to classify data based on its proximity to other data points.

3. **Decision Trees**: Decision Trees help in understanding the key factors driving the classification of data.

## Results

The project evaluates the performance of each model, measuring accuracy, F1 score, ROC AUC, and other relevant metrics. Comparative analysis of these metrics is presented to determine the effectiveness of each model.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malware-detection.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd malware-detection
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Malware_ML.ipynb` to execute the code and explore the results.
